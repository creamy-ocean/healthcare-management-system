# healthcare-management-system
This project is the final assignment for the DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) unit. It is a python-based healthcare management system, in which various data structures, ADTS, and algorithms are implemented. It allows users to add/update patients' records, and retrieve patient medical histories.
<br/>
This project aims to obtain the following objectives:
- Implement a <b>Healthcare Management System</b> using Python.
- Adopt different ADTs and algorithms for implementation:
  - Create a Patient class to represent each patient
  - Use hash table for adding, updating, and deleting patient records
  - Adopt linear probing for hash key collision handling
  - Implement linked list to store patients' medical histories
- Design test cases and test the production code using both black-box and white-box testing methods
- Use Git for version control throughout the entire process

The production code (numerology analysis tool) analyzes a given birthday and returns the following:
- The Lucky Number
- The Lucky Animal
- Whether the Lucky Number is a master number
- The generation of the person

When two birthdays are provided, it checks whether their Lucky Numbers and Animals are the same. The test code includes unit tests for each function in the production code, using different types of input data (e.g., keyboard input, function parameters, and text file input). All test results and a summary of the work are recorded in this report.
